Overview

In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

Python

A text editor, like Sublime or Atom

A terminal application
